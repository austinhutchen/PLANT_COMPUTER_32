# AUTOMATIC ESP32 IRRIGATION WORKER
Called a "Plant Kernel", I built this project to manage and provide for the soil needs of a plant with moisture measured by a  capacative moisture sensor and ESP32. A Normally Closed 3.3v octocoupled relay pumps the water downstream to keep the plant watered as needed, or at regular intervals.
